#### Inovelli Status Manager Node

Forked from the exceptionally wonderful https://github.com/pdong/node-contrib-inovelli-status-manager repo.

This node allows you to easily set the appropriate value to send to your Inovelli red series switch.

It should be used in conjunction with the node-redâ€“contrib-home-assistant add on and the output should
be connected to a api-call-service node that is set to do a `svc: zwave:set_config_parameter`.  The values
from this node will get merged into the `svc: set_config_parameter`.

If you notice any problems open an issue or a pull request.  Thanks.
